### Challenges (you can include images and code block here)
1. The winning condition is the main challenge I faced during the past week in order to overcome if i had to get the help of a friend to understand the logc but it was overcome in the end.
2. Another challenge I faced was stopping the player from being able to overwrite the start points that are placed at the begining of the game. The soulution did end up being quite simple but it did not seem it at the time.


### Learning points
1. The entire game week has been such good learning experinece for javascript and coding concepts in general. I feel like have gained a lot of knowledge and did not think i would be able to take the game as far as i have.
